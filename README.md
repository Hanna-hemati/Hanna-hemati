- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hanna-hemati👩‍💻, a computer engineering student and passionate learner. I'm especially interested in ☁️ cloud computing, 🚀 DevOps, and 💻 software development.
When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me 🖥 tinkering with Raspberry Pis, 📚 reading comics.
I'm always eager to take on new challenges and projects. If you're working on something cool, I'd 💝 love to collaborate! Feel free to reach out if you'd like to 💬 chat about tech, share coding tips, or just say hello.

Oh, and did I mention I work from the comfort of my own 🏡? Pajamas are the best coding attire 👍
